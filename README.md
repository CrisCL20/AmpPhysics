# AmpPhysics engine!

This is the first physics engine I do so I still have a lot to learn to completely develop this thing and get it somewhere, just hope for it to be used in some physics field :>

To build on Linux you just need to have installed [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation) and then run 
```console
./build.sh && ./engine
```
to compile and run the engine. I'm using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Ubuntu) for compiling so if it does not work for you please let me know!
